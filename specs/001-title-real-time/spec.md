# Feature Specification: Real-Time Sensor Analytics Dashboard ‚Äî Functional Spec

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-real-time`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description captured via /specify (dashboard shows streaming sensor data in real time, highlights anomalies, retains last 24h; stories, FRs/NFRs, and conceptual contracts provided).

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As an operator, I see a live chart that updates smoothly with current sensor readings and can quickly spot anomalies while the system keeps the last 24 hours of data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given sensors are streaming at 1,000 readings/sec across N sensors, when the dashboard is open, then the live chart updates smoothly (‚â•30 FPS) and shows current values with rolling stats.
2. Given rolling windows are set to 1m/5m/15m/1h/24h, when I switch the selected window, then the chart and stats update responsively without UI jank.
3. Given anomaly detection thresholds are configured, when a sensor‚Äôs reading produces |z| ‚â• 3 (or EWMA¬±kœÉ breach), then an alert is raised with severity and appears in the UI for acknowledgement.
4. Given a temporary network disconnect, when the client reconnects, then the UI receives the last few seconds of data to heal gaps and resumes live updates. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many seconds to backfill?]

### Edge Cases
- Burst above 1,000 readings/sec for short intervals ‚Äî system should coalesce frames and bound queues; drops are observable.
- Very high sensor count N (e.g., thousands) ‚Äî charts remain usable via decimation/delta delivery. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected max N?]
- Out-of-order or delayed events ‚Äî aggregates remain correct; late data policy defined. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: accept late data within what window?]
- Client tab inactive/hidden ‚Äî reduce frame rate but keep stats accurate.
- Clock skew between producer and UI ‚Äî use server timestamps for ordering.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The simulator MUST produce ‚â•1,000 readings/sec across configurable N sensors (rate and N are runtime-configurable).
- **FR-002**: The system MUST compute rolling aggregates in near real time per sensor and globally for windows {1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 24h}.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST detect anomalies using Z-score (|z| ‚â• 3) or EWMA¬±kœÉ with configurable thresholds; the chosen default method MUST be documented. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default method and k]
- **FR-004**: Live delivery MUST use push updates; the UI MUST receive coalesced frames at approximately 10‚Äì20 FPS containing only deltas.
- **FR-005**: Data MUST be retained for 24 hours and auto-purged via TTL or equivalent mechanism.
- **FR-006**: On reconnect, the client MUST receive the last X seconds of data to heal gaps before resuming live updates. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: X seconds]
- **FR-007**: The UI MUST present alerts with severity and allow operator acknowledgement; acknowledged alerts MUST be tracked. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: severity scale (e.g., info/warn/critical)? persistence of acks?]
- **FR-008**: Operators MUST be able to switch time windows (1m/5m/15m/1h/24h), and the chart and aggregates MUST update responsively.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide both per-sensor and global aggregates within the current window.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001 (Performance)**: Frontend MUST maintain ‚â•30 FPS while holding ‚â•100,000 points in memory without visible jank. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum memory budget on client]
- **NFR-002 (Latency)**: Median ingest‚Üípaint latency MUST be <200 ms under normal load; during bursts, drops MUST be minimal and measurable. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable p95 latency and max drop %]
- **NFR-003 (Observability)**: The system MUST expose ingest rate, processing latency, hub fan-out latency, queue depth, and drop rate as metrics; structured logs and minimal traces are required.
- **NFR-004 (Operability)**: Local environment MUST be reproducible with Docker and support a one-command bring-up/teardown.
- **NFR-005 (Security)**: No secrets in repo; local HTTPS; API-key required for access (per Constitution).

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **Reading**: { sensorId, ts, value, status }
- **Aggregate**: { sensorId|null, window, count, min, max, mean, stdev, p95 }
- **Alert**: { id, sensorId, ts, type, message, severity, ack }
