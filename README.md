## Using slash commands

This repo is configured with Copilot Chat slash commands under `.github/prompts` to help you go from idea → spec → plan → tasks → implementation.

Quickstart inside Copilot Chat:

1. Create a feature spec:
	- `/specify <your feature description>`
2. Clarify the spec (optional but recommended):
	- `/clarify`
3. Generate the implementation plan and design artifacts:
	- `/plan`
4. Generate an actionable task list:
	- `/tasks`
5. Analyze for gaps (read-only):
	- `/analyze`
6. Implement according to tasks:
	- `/implement`

See `.github/prompts/README.md` for details on each command and prerequisites.
